        "description": "I come from the Boston area so naturally I am a huge Boston sports fan. My grandparents come from England right outside of London, and thus I'm a massive Tottenham Hotspur fan. My favorite sports to watch are Ice Hockey, Soccer, and Basketball. During the school year I play intramural Hockey and Soccer with my Fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi. This love for sports is what's inspire me to creating my personal Fantasy Sports website, which at is still in development."
